# Dataset Description

> In this document, multiple frequently used datasets in traffic flow prediction will be introduced. They vary in their size, content, publicity and accessibility. A fraction of them are accompanied with visualizations. Besides, frequent measurements used will also be displayed along with the easy Python code.

## METR-LA

This dataset comes from the communications of the ACM, 2014 Big Data and Its Technical Challenges. Itâ€™s the speed captured from the loop detectors installed in the highway of Los Angeles County. There are **207** sensors and the data are collected for 4 months from May 1st 2012 to Jun 30th 2012. The data was processed into **5 min windows**. Thus for each day, there are **288 samples/day** . The file is stored in `.h5` file and should be opened with python module `hd5y`. The data can be read with the following code

```Python
# ## Read the metr_la data
data_name = 'metr-la'
data_path = 'data/' + data_name + '.h5'
df = pd.read_hdf(data_path)
print(df.shape)
print(df)
```

In this way, the read dataframe is with shape **(34727, 207)**. The column is the sensor id while the index is the timestamp of the data caputred. The visualization of the data is as follows:

## PEMS-BAY

PEMS-Bay is collected b California Transportation Agencies Performance Measurement Systems. There are **325** sensors for **6 months** data ranging from 1st 2017 to May 31tst 2017. The data is still windowed in **5 min** window width. In can be read in the following code

```python
# ## Read the pems_bay data
data_name = 'pems-bay'
data_path = 'data/' + data_name + '.h5'
df = pd.read_hdf(data_path)
print(df.shape)
print(df)
```

In this way, the read dataframe is with shape **(52116, 325)**. The column is the sensor id while the index is the timestamp of the data caputred. The visualization of the data is as follows:
